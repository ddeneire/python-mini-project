# Motion Detection Program using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes the MediaPipe library along with OpenCV to perform real-time motion detection using a pose estimation model. The script reads a video file (`workout.mp4` in this case) frame by frame, processes each frame to detect human poses, and visualizes the detected poses along with the frame's FPS (frames per second). 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Features
- Real-time motion detection using pose estimation
- Visualization of detected poses and FPS on each frame
